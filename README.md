# Presentation for the BFPG

## Introduction
* Why we started the group
** Motivation (Learning Haskell is hard)

## The group
* How we started the group
** Meetup
** Github
* The first members
* How we ran the group
   * Chapter leaders
   * Exercises
   * Safe place to learn / No Ego
   * Difficult topics were broken across multiple sessions
   * Always there to help the chapter leaders should they need it
   * Lead the chapters no one else wants
   * Review everyone's answers to the exercises - everyone has a voice
* Selection criteria
   * 1.5 hours
   * 3 Months
   * Lots of self study

## Benefits of Learning Haskell
* Helps you talk the FP talk
* Understand Java / Scala / JavaScript 
* Rewires your brain
* Identify patterns eg map-reduce, filter
* Converting Haskell to our day-jobs: map-reduce, filter, folds
* Helps you get the most out of the BFPG
* Makes abstraction simple
* Learnt more in-depth as a group than individuals
* Everyone brings different perspective
* Tangents: Andrew - Category theory, Javascript monads, Steve - Linux, Clojure, Opensource, Coding By Numbers
* Identifying, understanding and using side-effects

## Sample Code We've Learned
* Interesting Solutions to Exercises
* Summary slide per chapter? (probably. Maybe skip Functionally solving Problems as it's covered through the others)
* Pattern-matching
* Applicatives
* Data types and typeclasses
* IO
* Other Monads? (State or Writer)

## What We'd do Differently Next Time
* Get everyone to research the topic (not just leaders)
* Notes on computers not printouts
* Live hacking sessions (we sometimes do this in the group already)

## The experience
* Took a lot of time and effort to learn Haskell - more than expected
* Use Haskell concepts as much as you can to gain an intuition about how things work - Helps with understanding 
the implementation. Eg. >>=.
* Committing to learning (almost) every week for 6 months is hard to sustain
* Staircase analogy
* Realise how easy the book made the content
* Enough knowledge to learn on our own

## Conclusion
* Advanced Beginners
* Learning together is fun!
