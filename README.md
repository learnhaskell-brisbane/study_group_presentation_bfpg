# Presentation for the BFPG

### What's the big idea?
* Inspire people to learn Haskell.  
* Inspire people to start a group.

## Outline
* Introduction
* The Group
** Chapter Leader Testimonial
* The Book
* The Experience
* Door Prize - Live code example
* Conclusion



## Introduction
* We've been coming to this group on and off for about 4yrs. Want to thank everyone that makes this group what it is, some experienced ppl with collective IQ of... and the newbies fresh and thirsty for functional knowledge, like me, you're the ones that smile and nod at everything Tony says.
* Why we started the group
** Motivation (Learning Haskell is hard)
* The problem
** We don't know enough Haskell to understand the BFPG meetups!
** We don't have the moitivation/focus to get all the way through the book without getting distracted.
....
* October Meetup
** Let's start a study group!



## The group
* How we started the group
** Research, bouncing ideas, talking to experts
** Meetup
** Github
* The first members
* How we ran the group
   * Chapter leaders
   * Exercises
   * Safe place to learn / No Ego
   * Difficult topics were broken across multiple sessions
   * Always there to help the chapter leaders should they need it
   * Lead the chapters no one else wants
   * Review everyone's answers to the exercises - everyone has a voice
* Selection criteria
   * 1.5 hours
   * 3 Months
   * Lots of self study
* What We'd do Differently Next Time
** Get everyone to research the topic (not just leaders)
** Notes on computers not printouts
** Live hacking sessions (we sometimes do this in the group already)
** Encourage crowd-sourcing of extra content

### The Chapter Leader Experience
* Knowing the content
* Pros/Cons
* Setting assignment
** Example



## The Book
* One short summary slide per chapter
* Sample Code We've Learned
** Interesting Solutions to Exercises
** Summary slide per chapter? (probably. Maybe skip Functionally solving Problems as it's covered through the others)
** Pattern-matching
** Applicatives
** Data types and typeclasses
** IO
** Other Monads? (State or Writer)

## The Experience
* Took a lot of time and effort to learn Haskell - more than expected
* Use Haskell concepts as much as you can to gain an intuition about how things work - Helps with understanding 
the implementation. Eg. >>=.
* Committing to learning (almost) every week for 6 months is hard to sustain
* Staircase analogy
* Realise how easy the book made the content
* Enough knowledge to learn on our own

## Conclusion
* Advanced Beginners
* Learning together is fun!
* Benefits of Learning Haskell
** Helps you talk the FP talk
** Understand Java / Scala / JavaScript 
** Rewires your brain
** Identify patterns eg map-reduce, filter
** Converting Haskell to our day-jobs: map-reduce, filter, folds
** Helps you get the most out of the BFPG
** Makes abstraction simple
** Learnt more in-depth as a group than individuals
** Everyone brings different perspective
** Tangents: Andrew - Category theory, Javascript monads, Steve - Linux, Clojure, Opensource, Coding By Numbers
** Identifying, understanding and using side-effects




## Humour
* Tony Chuck Norris jokes
* Our next item in our line of apparel is bracelets that say WWTD (What Would Tony Do)
