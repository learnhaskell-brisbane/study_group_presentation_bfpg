# Presentation for the BFPG

### What's the big idea?
* Inspire people to learn Haskell.  
* Inspire people to start a group.

## Outline
* Introduction - 5mins
* The Group - 5mins
** Chapter Leader Testimonial - 5mins
* The Book - 5mins
* The Experience - 5mins
* Conclusion incl Q/A - 5mins
* Door Prize - Live code example - 5mins


## Introduction
* We've been coming to this group on and off for about 4yrs. Want to thank everyone that makes this group what it is, some experienced ppl with collective IQ of... and the newbies fresh and thirsty for functional knowledge, like me, you're the ones that smile and nod at everything Tony says.
* Why we started the group
** Motivation (Learning Haskell is hard)
* The problem
** We don't know enough Haskell to understand the BFPG meetups!
*** Intimidating for beginners - we didn't want to admit don't know
*** We were part of a culture amongst FP beginners of pretending to understand (scared to admit you don't know)
*** Two types of people: Those that had learnt Haskell, those that hadn't. Had to start at lowest common denominator
** We don't have the moitivation/focus to get all the way through the book without getting distracted.
....
* October Meetup
** Let's start a study group!
* Someone is handing out tickets for our door prize at the end - if you don't want to win a copy of the book don't take a ticket!



## The group
* How we started the group
** Research, bouncing ideas, talking to experts
** Meetup
** Github
* Find an accomplice
 * 2 heads better than one
 * share responsibility & workload
  * As long as both committed, passionate, energy
   * Doesn't matter if no one shows
* Ask for advice
 * We approached OJ to see if we could run a covert functional group in Brisbane...
 * Got some idea from Craig Aspinall 
 * Miran: Online? book? Free PDF!  Feedback, encouragement.
* The first members
* How we ran the group
 * Make strong decisions up-front
 * Set some groundrules
  * Time/date
  * 1.5hr lunchtimes - every week
  * Set the culture - makes the rest of the group easy
  * Set clear objectives for group 
   * Get through the book
   * Rough chapter plan - finite time period - 4 months
   * Timeliness
  * Not about ego, about learning. No silly questions
  * Encourage members to write down questions during week
  * "Each member should come to sessions fully prepared to participate. Your study group can't run properly if no one has done the work"
  * Punctuality
  * Have fun
  * Start strong, set culture, clear goals
  * Chapter leaders
 * Exercises
 * Safe place to learn / No Ego - important as 
 * Difficult topics were broken across multiple sessions
 * Always there to help the chapter leaders should they need it
 * Lead the chapters no one else wants
 * Review everyone's answers to the exercises - everyone has a voice
* Selection criteria
 * 1.5 hours
 * 3 Months
 * Lots of self study
* Statistics
 * # weeks
 * # hours/week
 * # people
* What We'd do Differently Next Time
 * Get everyone to research the topic (not just leaders)
 * Notes on computers not printouts
 * Live hacking sessions (we sometimes do this in the group already)
 * Encourage crowd-sourcing of extra content

### The Chapter Leader Experience
* Chapter Leaders
 * Everyone takes ownership
 * Facilitate conversation
 * Keep conversation moving
 * Have plenty to talk about to fill in gaps
 * Prepare exercises for group to complete
 * Discuss solutions to exercises
 * Open-source lecturing
* Knowing the content
* Pros/Cons
* Setting assignment
 * Example


## The Book
* One short summary slide per chapter
* Sample Code We've Learned
 * Interesting Solutions to Exercises
 * Summary slide per chapter? (probably. Maybe skip Functionally solving Problems as it's covered through the others)
 * Pattern-matching
 * Applicatives
 * Data types and typeclasses
 * IO
 * Other Monads? (State or Writer)
* Example code (tantalizing - not off-putting)
 * Basic syntax: 
  * List Comprehensions, Tuples, Pattern matching, guards, where, let, case... 
  * currying, partial application, function composition, lambdas
 * Do notation
 * Pattern matching
 * Algebraic data types (e.g. Maybe)
  * How does it differ to Classes?
 * Monads


## The Experience
* Took a lot of time and effort to learn Haskell - more than expected
* Use Haskell concepts as much as you can to gain an intuition about how things work - Helps with understanding 
the implementation. Eg. >>=.
* Committing to learning (almost) every week for 6 months is hard to sustain
* Staircase analogy
* Realise how easy the book made the content
* Enough knowledge to learn on our own
* Side discussions were sometimes more beneficial than the book content
 
## Conclusion
* Advanced Beginners
* Learning together is fun!
* Benefits of Learning Haskell
** Helps you talk the FP talk
** Understand Java / Scala / JavaScript 
** Rewires your brain
** Identify patterns eg map-reduce, filter
** Converting Haskell to our day-jobs: map-reduce, filter, folds
** Helps you get the most out of the BFPG
** Makes abstraction simple
** Learnt more in-depth as a group than individuals
** Everyone brings different perspective
** Tangents: Andrew - Category theory, Javascript monads, Steve - Linux, Clojure, Opensource, Coding By Numbers
** Identifying, understanding and using side-effects
* We want to help get you started
 * Ask anyone wearing one of these fashionable lambda shirts about it.
 * Happy to help kickstart your group and connect wannabe Haskellesrs together.
* One lucky person will win their own copy of the book - door prize - randomly selected by Haskell itself.
* 

## Door Prize
* Show off some code
* Run the code
* Find the winner
* Hand out the prize!!!



## Humour
* Tony Chuck Norris jokes
* Our next item in our line of apparel is bracelets that say WWTD (What Would Tony Do)
